  <p>I love music. It’s been very important to me throughout my life. For I am going on my 10th year of playing the cello. I take lessons and play in orchestras and with my sisters (who also play instruments). I also love singing. I’m in a selective choir at my school and have been hand picked to be in the accapella group.Music is wonderful at any time. It is a stress reliever and a joy in my life.</p>
