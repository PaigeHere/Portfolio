    <h2>MUSIC</h2>
    <p>I love music. It’s been very important to me throughout my life. For I am going on my 10th year of playing the cello. I take lessons and play in orchestras and with my sisters (who also play instruments). I also love singing. I’m in a selective choir at my school and have been hand picked to be in the accapella group.Music is wonderful at any time. It is a stress reliever and a joy in my life.</p>
    <h2>PEOPLE</h2>
    <p>I'm a people person.
    <h2>FOOD</h2>
    <p>At my school we have 5 Goals that we try to aim to always exhibit in our lives (wise freedom, Faith. Service etc) We like to joke that the 6th goal is Food. I love veggies, fruits, meat, dairy, and sweets. Some of my favorite foods are meatloaf, lemons (I lOVE chicken lemon), ice cream cake, and lots of BBQed foods. I also love crepes and waffles.</p>
