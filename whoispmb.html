  <p>
    My name is Paige Margaret Bartusiak (or PMB). I go to an all girls high school called Woodlands Academy of the Sacred Heart. 
    I will be a Junior in the Fall.  I come from a family of 7 (a Mom, Dad, and 5 girls). I am number 4 out of 5. I live in the
    Northern suburbs of Chicago. I lived in Deerfield until the fifth grade when my family moved to Lake Forest. I am a girl with diverse
    interests in art, music, math, business, and psychology. One day I hope to be bilingual (at least). I would love to learn French, 
    Japanese, and Spanish. I love learning and getting to know people.</p>
